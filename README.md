# Node.js: Microservices


In this fast-paced era of distributed systems, mastering microservices—not just deploying services, but truly understanding the patterns and principles that drive them— is essential for developers. And in organizations large and small, Node.js is often the platform of choice for building microservices architectures. In This project I did how to use Node.js to create a microservice architecture from scratch and tackles the all-too-common challenge of transforming a monolithic app into a flexible, modular system composed of individual services. Throughout the project, I will explores crucial concepts like service discovery, resilience, and decoupling.
